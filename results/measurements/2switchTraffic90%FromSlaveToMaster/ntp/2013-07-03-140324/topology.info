ClockPeriod(): 39390ns

measure period: 130s
network load: 90% through 100MBit shared line (slave -> master)
system load: none
time synchronization: NTP
PTP/NTP daemon priority: -25

notes
  ran with disabled logging (neither to syslog nor to stdout/stderr)
  ntpq -p announced 6.729[slave] jitter before starting the load
                    6.015[slave] jitter under load after 20 hours of running load
