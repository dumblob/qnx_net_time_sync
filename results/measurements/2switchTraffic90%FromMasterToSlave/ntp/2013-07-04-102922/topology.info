ClockPeriod(): 39390ns

measure period: 130s
network load: 90% through 100MBit shared line (master -> slave)
system load: none
time synchronization: NTP
PTP/NTP daemon priority: -25
edge_generator priority: -28
FitKit calibration: none

notes
  ran with disabled logging (neither to syslog nor to stdout/stderr)
  ntpq -p announced <nonsense-see-photos>[slave] jitter before starting the load
                    <not_saved>[slave] jitter under load after 20 hours of running load
