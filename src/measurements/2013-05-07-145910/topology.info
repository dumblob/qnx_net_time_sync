# Topology specification (how many and which components, which
#   settings, which wiring...)
# measure: 2013-05-07-145910

ClockPeriod(): 39390ns

measure period: 130s
network load: 100% through wire between two switches in direction NTP master -> NTP slave
system load: none
time synchronization: NTP
PTP/NTP daemon priority: -25
edge_generator priority: -28
FitKit calibration: none

traffic load started cca 1 minute before the measurement started
NTP was already running cca 40 minut at the time of measurement start
