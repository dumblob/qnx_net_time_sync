  BMC best master clock
    computed from different infos including hop-count => measure latency between
      2 PTP master stations through a different number of routers
  use PTPd in "relay" mode

  NTP description
  inturrupt handler each 1ms (== clock period == QNX "tick"), min == 10us
    The timeslice rate (for “round-robin” and “other” scheduling
    policies) is always four times the clock period (this isn't
    changeable).

  Atom system was totally unusefull when ethernet load was 100%
    nothing worked and QNX always stopped working (freeze) after a short
    period of time while running demanding applications showed different errors
    then the QNX host with Atom started to fail almost in every load - after
    a few seconds of running compilation and the like the system
    inevitably hanged. Note that these problems appeared both with ethernet
    cable connected and disconnected
  nice - pro usera jine nez roota, ale mereni pod rootem, takze na max!
  u PTP zatizeni master => pruser
                 slave => temer bez rozdilu
  u NTP zatizeni master => temer bez rozdilu
                 slave => pruser (protoze tam ten vymenny mechanismus
                                  zprav zacina opacne)
