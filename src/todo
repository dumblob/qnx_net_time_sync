  BMC best master clock
    computed from different infos including hop-count => measure latency between
      2 PTP master stations through a different number of routers
  use PTPd in "relay" mode

  NTP description
  inturrupt handler each 1ms (== clock period == QNX "tick"), min == 10us
    The timeslice rate (for “round-robin” and “other” scheduling
    policies) is always four times the clock period (this isn't
    changeable).

  Atom system was totally unusefull when ethernet load was 100%
    nothing worked and QNX always stopped working (freeze) after a short
    period of time while running demanding applications showed different errors
    then the QNX host with Atom started to fail almost in every load - after
    a few seconds of running compilation and the like the system
    inevitably hanged. Note that these problems appeared both with ethernet
    cable connected and disconnected
  after 18hours of frames with non-matching MAC addr 100% bandwidth load,
    the QNX C2D PC stopped to respond to ARPs
  nice - pro usera jine nez roota, ale mereni pod rootem, takze na max!
  u PTP zatizeni master => pruser
                 slave => temer bez rozdilu
  u NTP zatizeni master => temer bez rozdilu
                 slave => pruser (protoze tam ten vymenny mechanismus
                                  zprav zacina opacne)

    performance of QNX messages/timers
    measure with relay/transparent_clock
    calibrate/designate_the_accuracy of FITkit crystal using GPS signal
    extend the measurements with measuring of timestamps (using Spirent etc.)
    discover the cause of performance problems on the Atom PC (why was NIC so red when compared to C2D PC where the NIC didn't show anything!)
    try adjusting the dispatch period of PTP/NTP messages and compare them
